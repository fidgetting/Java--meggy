This is a compiler for the meggy java language presented in my compilers class
for the spring of 2011 semester. As the language is very similar to standard
Java, the class originally used Java as the language to write the compiler in.
In the interest of learning other parser generators, I have started rewritting
the compiler in C++.

This project is not complete. Currently the compiler can only read a meggy java
file and produce a dot file for the abstract syntax tree and the symbol table.
The type checker is a work in progress, and the code generator hasn't beend
started yet.
